## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **Activity Drives Calories:**  
   More steps and especially high-intensity (very active) minutes significantly increase calorie burn.

2. **Sleep Isn’t Tied to Activity:**  
   No strong correlation between calories burned and sleep duration — suggests sleep should be treated as a standalone wellness focus.

3. **Hourly Trends Matter:**  
   Most users are active from **7–11 AM** and **5–7 PM**, which can inform notification and content timing.
